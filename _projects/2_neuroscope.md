NeuroScope is a Python library designed to make AI interpretability accessible. It allows researchers to visualize the internal state of neural networks during training.

**Features:**
* **Activation Histograms:** Visualize how neuron activations are distributed across layers.
* **Gradient Flow Analysis:** Track gradient norms to detect vanishing or exploding gradients.
* **Training Dynamics:** Watch how weights evolve over time with animated histograms.

The library is built with **Plotly** for interactive charts and integrates seamlessly with PyTorch training loops.
