NeuroScope is a Python frameworl designed to make AI interpretability accessible. It allows researchers to visualize the internal state of neural networks during training.

**Features:**

- **Activation Histograms:** Visualize how neuron activations are distributed across layers.
- **Gradient Flow Analysis:** Track gradient norms to detect vanishing or exploding gradients.
- **Training Dynamics:** Watch how weights evolve over time with animated histograms.

The framework is built with only **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.
