House Oracle is a full-stack Machine Learning application that predicts house prices based on location, area, and amenities.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript for a responsive UI.
- **ML Pipeline:** Trained on city-specific datasets (Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad) using predictive modeling.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Users can explore price trends and property distributions directly in the browser.

The system uses pre-computed artifacts to serve predictions instantly without needing a heavy backend server.
